# Core Java

#### Introduction to Java 
>Java is a general purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented computer programming language. Java compilers virtual machines, and class libraries were developed by Sun from 1991. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
#### Java Token Set
>A Java program is basically a collection of classes. A class is defined by a set of declaration statements and methods containing executable statements. Most statements contain expressions, which describe the actions carried out on data. Smallest individual unit in a program are known as tokens. The compiler recognizes them for building up expressions and statements. 

#### Data types 
>A data type in a programming language is a set of data with values having predefined characteristics. Examples of data types are: integer,floating point unit number,character, string, and pointer. 
#### Classes in Java  
>A class specifies the design of an object. It states what data an object can hold and the way it can behave when using the data. 
#### Control statements in Java
>The control statement is used to control the flow of execution of the program .This execution order depends on the supplied data values and the conditional logic 
#### OOPS
>Java is an object oriented language. Java, unlike some other languages, is considered as a pure object oriented language as everything in java should be enclosed, basically inside a class. There can be no global variables or functions. 

#### Encapsulation and Inheritance 
>Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods. Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. 

#### Polymorphism 
>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

#### Final Keyword(variables),Construct in Java 
>The Final Keyword in java is used to restrict the user. It can be used in many contexts. Final can be a variable, a method or a class. 

#### Enum,Static Variable,Static Void and Static Method
>Enum in Java is a keyword, a feature which is used to represent fixed number of well known values in Java. The static keyword is used in java mainly for memory management. We may apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested class. 

#### Java IO Introduction and Scan 
>The java.io package contains two classes, InputStream and OutputStream, from which most of the other classes in the package derive. 

#### Exception Handling in Java
>An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. 

#### Object Serialization and Persistence
>Java provides a mechanism, called object serialization where an object can be represented as a sequence of bytes that includes the object's data as well as information about the object's type and the types of data stored in the object. Object persistence, is the term you often hear used in conjunction with the issue of storing objects in databases. 

#### Collection of Framework 
>The collection framework provides a unified interface to store, retrieve and manipulate the elements of a collection, regardless of the underlying and actual implementation. This allows the programmers to program at the interfaces, instead of the actual implementation. 

#### Comperator Interface
>Comparator interface is used to order the objects of user-defined class .This interface is found in java.util package and contains only one method named compare.
